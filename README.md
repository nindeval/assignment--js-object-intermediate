# JS Object Intermediate

## The Assignment

The purpose of this assignment is to improve your understanding of object methods and iterating over objects with `for...in` loops. 


### Setup
```sh
# (1) Go to your  muktek/assignments directory and create the `js-object-intermediate` folder for this assignment
cd ~/Documents/muktek/assignments
mkdir js-object-intermediate
cd js-object-intermediate


# (2) Download the assignment-files with curl from the assignment repo and unzip

### Instructions

The goal of these exercises is to write the logic in the function to solve the problem.   The statements/declarations in the `console.assert(...)` describe the expected output from the function *when provided with a given input* and should evaluate to true if you have written the function correctly.

Here is how you will answer each exercise:

(1) Read the problem

(2) Look at the expected output
- you instructors have written these `console.assert()` statements to ensure that you have written the exercise function correctly

(3) Write the function and the logic

**Note**
For the `ex-01`, `ex-02`, and `ex-03` you will need to write *the functions as methods*.
