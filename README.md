### Instructions

The goal of these exercises is to write the logic in the function to solve the problem.   The statements/declarations in the `console.assert(...)` describe the expected output from the function *when provided with a given input* and should evaluate to true if you have written the function correctly.

Here is how you will answer each exercise:

(1) Read the problem

(2) Look at the expected output
- you instructors have written these `console.assert()` statements to ensure that you have written the exercise function correctly

(3) Write the function and the logic

**Note**
For the `ex-01`, `ex-02`, and `ex-03` you will need to write *the functions as methods*.
